# ATTX
The code aims to simulate flipping of five unfair coins each with the unique probability of landing heads with a goal to maximize the number of heads observed in a set of 20 flips (one run). The code design includes the following functionality:
•	Simulating coin flips based on given probabilities.
•	Gathering data through an initial exploration phase.
•	Using the gathered data to make informed decisions on subsequent flips.
•	Performing 100 runs to compute and analyze the statistics of the algorithm.
